Practical 1 CLI commands

A). Configuring OSPF 

in Router 1

router ospf 1
network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.3 area 0

in Router 2

router ospf 2
network 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
network 10.2.2.0 0.0.0.3 area 0

in Router 3

router ospf 3
network 192.168.3.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 10.2.2.0 0.0.0.3 area 0



B). MD5 Authentication

in Router 1

router ospf 1
area 0 authentication message-digest
interface s0/0/0
ip ospf message-digest key 1 md5 MD5pa55

in Router 2

router ospf 2
area 0 authentication message-digest
interface s0/0/0
ip ospf message-digest key 1 md5 MD5pa55
interface s0/0/1
ip ospf message-digest key 1 md5 MD5pa55

in Router 3

router ospf 3
area 0 authentication message-digest
interface s0/0/0
ip ospf message-digest key 1 md5 MD5pa55

show this command in all the Router CLIs to check for MD5 configuration : show ip ospf interface 




C). NTP Authentication

in PC-A, go to services tab and click NTP to check if NTP service is On or Off. Enable NTP Authentication by clicking Enable under Authentication, then choose date and time different from current time. then set key as 1 and password as NTPpa55.

then, in each router, go to CLI and write these commands:

ntp server 192.168.1.5
ntp update-calendar
ntp authenticate
ntp authentication-key 1 md5 NTPpa55
service timestamps log datetime rsec

after that, for logging, go to PC-B, then check if syslog is enabled. if not, go to each router's CLI and write the command "logging host 192.168.1.6", and for output, go to each router and type "show logging"



D). SSH Authentication

go to R3 CLI and write the following commands:

ip domain-name ccnasecurity.com
username SSHadmin privilege 15 secret ciscosshpa55
line vty 0 4
login local
transport input ssh
crypto key zeroize rsa
crypto key generate rsa (after that, type 1024)

after that,
ex
show ip ssh

then close and go to config again and type this

ip ssh time-out 90
ip ssh authentication-retries 2
ip ssh version 2
ex
show ip ssh

then go to PC-C → Desktop → Command Prompt → type this command "telnet 192.168.3.1" to verify that input method is SSH

then type ssh -l SSHadmin 192.168.3.1, password is ciscosshpa55
again type show ip ssh when logged in successfully

we can also connect R2 with R3 from R2 CLI using command ssh -v 2 -l SSHadmin 10.2.2.1 without R2(config), just at R2. then type password as ciscosshpa55
